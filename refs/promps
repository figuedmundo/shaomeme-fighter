 Here is the Best Prompt to use. I have designed it to generate the specific poses we programmed into the engine:

  Recommended AI Prompt

    1 pixel art spritesheet strip of a street fighter character, Ken Masters style, wearing red karate gi, blonde hair.
    2 The image must be a wide horizontal strip with a white background.
    3 The strip contains exactly 18 distinct character poses arranged side-by-side in this order:
    4 4 poses breathing idle,
    5 6 poses walking forward cycle,
    6 1 pose jumping,
    7 1 pose crouching,
    8 3 poses punching (windup, punch, retract),
    9 1 pose getting hit,
   10 1 pose blocking,
   11 1 pose falling down defeated.
   12 Full body characters, side view profile, 16-bit arcade style, clean distinct outlines, consistent size.

  Tips for Success:
   1. Aspect Ratio (`--ar 9:1`): This is crucial (for Midjourney). It forces the AI to create a long, thin image, which naturally encourages
      it to place characters in a row.
   2. "Side-by-Side": This keyword helps prevent the AI from making a grid (rows and columns) and instead makes a strip.
   3. Post-Processing: AI rarely gets the math perfect (e.g., exactly 100px spacing).
       * After you generate the image, you will likely need to open it in an editor (Photoshop/GIMP).
       * Resize the whole image height to 200px.
       * Crop/Resize the width to 1800px.
       * Manually nudge the characters so one is centered every 100 pixels.

  Once you have the new image:
   1. Name it ken.png.
   2. Replace the file in assets/fighters/ken/.
   3. Reload the game

> if I want the images are more modern, and not so retro style ?

✦ If you prefer a modern, high-definition (HD) style (like Street Fighter V, Guilty Gear, or a hand-drawn anime look) instead of retro pixel
  art, you just need to adjust the style keywords in the prompt while keeping the structural instructions (the "strip" layout) the same.

  Here are three modern style variations you can try. Choose the one that fits your vision:

  Option 1: "Modern Anime / Hand-Drawn 2D" (Like Skullgirls or Hades)
  Best for a crisp, clean look that scales well.

   1 character spritesheet strip of a martial artist fighter, Ken Masters style, red karate gi.
   2 High resolution 2D vector art, hand-drawn anime style, cell shaded, cel-shaded, crisp thick outlines.
   3 Wide horizontal strip, white background.
   4 18 distinct poses side-by-side in order: 4 idle breathing, 6 walking, 1 jump, 1 crouch, 3 punching, 1 hit reaction, 1 block, 1 collapsed
     on ground.
   5 Side view, dynamic lighting, 4k, mobile game asset.
   6 --ar 9:1 --v 6.0

  Option 2: "3D Rendered / 2.5D" (Like Street Fighter V or Mortal Kombat)
  Best for a more realistic, detailed look.

   1 3D character spritesheet strip of a fighter, Ken Masters, red gi.
   2 3D rendered style, Unreal Engine 5 render, realistic lighting, semi-realistic textures.
   3 Wide horizontal strip, white background.
   4 18 distinct poses arranged horizontally: 4 idle stance, 6 walking cycle, 1 jump, 1 crouch, 3 punch attack, 1 damaged, 1 blocking, 1 
     defeated.
   5 Side profile view, full body, volumetric lighting, high fidelity.
   6 --ar 9:1 --v 6.0

  Option 3: "Painterly / Concept Art" (Like Braid or Street Fighter 4 Ink)
  Best for an artistic, stylized aesthetic.

   1 character spritesheet strip of a fighter, Ken Masters, red gi.
   2 Digital painting style, visible brushstrokes, ink splash effects, artistic concept art style.
   3 Wide horizontal layout, white background.
   4 18 distinct poses side-by-side: 4 idle, 6 walking, 1 jump, 1 crouch, 3 punch action, 1 hit, 1 block, 1 knockout.
   5 Side view, expressive gestures, vibrant colors.
   6 --ar 9:1 --v 6.0

  Important Technical Note for HD Sprites
  When you move away from pixel art, the "edges" of the character might be softer.
   1. Transparency: You will definitely need to use a tool (like Photoshop or an online "Background Remover") to turn the white background
      transparent.
   2. Size: Modern HD sprites usually need more pixels. The current game is set to 100x200 per frame.
       * If your generated image is highly detailed, you might want to keep it larger (e.g., 200x400 frames).
       * If you do that, simply tell me, "I have a new spritesheet and the frame size is [Width] x [Height]," and I can update the code
         (Fighter.js) to support the higher resolution
