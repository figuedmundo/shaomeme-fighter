Refined Prompt for Midjourney/v6:
  > [Character Description, e.g., A cyborg monk], full body character spritesheet, 8x4 grid, orthographic side profile view, 3D rendered style, Unreal Engine
  5, realistic textures, pure white background, consistent character model, multiple action poses including idle, walking, punching, and falling. High
  contrast, sharp edges, evenly spaced sequence --no shadows, perspective, blur, gradient --ar 1:1 --stylize 250 --v 6.0

  3. Key Issues to Watch Out For
   * Volumetric Lighting vs. White Background: These two conflict. Volumetric lighting needs "fog" or "dust" to be visible, which will create gray smudges on
     your white background, making it impossible to get clean transparency. Recommendation: Use "studio lighting" or "rim lighting" instead.
   * The 200x400 Aspect Ratio: Most AI models prefer square (1:1) or wide (3:2) generation. If you use --ar 2:3, the AI might try to stack frames vertically.
     Stick to --ar 1:1 for the generation, then we can crop/resize to the 200x400 frame size later.

  4. How I can help
  If you generate an image that has, say, 20 good frames but they are in a 5x4 grid instead of an 8x4 grid:
   1. Upload the image here.
   2. I can write a script to automatically slice those frames and re-arrange them into the correct 8x4 layout required by the Fighter.js logic.

  Would you like me to create a small Python script for you that takes a raw AI "grid" and converts it into the specific 8x4 format?

> I dont understand for the die in the floor position, how it will fit in a rectangle 200x400 , because if it is in the floor, it will have more a style
  400x200

✦ That is an excellent observation. You are mathematically correct: a character standing 400px tall who then lies flat on the ground would typically be wider
  than 200px.

  In 2D fighting games with narrow frame widths (like our 200x400), there are three ways this is usually handled:

  1. The "Foreshortened" Death (Recommended for 200x400)
  Instead of the character lying perfectly flat sideways (like a _), they are drawn as if they fell slightly toward or away from the camera at an angle.
   * Their head might be near the top-left of the box and their feet near the bottom-right.
   * This uses the diagonal of the 200x400 box, giving you much more room (~440px of space).

  2. The "Crumple" Pose
  Most modern mobile fighters avoid the "plank" death. The character collapses into a heap:
   * Knees tucked in.
   * Arms pulled close to the chest.
   * This keeps the horizontal width under 200px while still looking like a "KO".

  3. Change the Grid to 400x400 (The "Pro" Solution)
  If you want the character to lie completely flat and take up a lot of horizontal space, we should update the code to use 400x400 frames instead.
   * Pros: Total freedom of movement; characters can do long-reaching kicks and lie flat.
   * Cons: The spritesheet becomes very large (3200 x 1600), which might hit memory limits on very old iPhones (iPhone 6/7).

  My Recommendation
  Since you are using AI to generate these, stick to the 200x400 logic for now but tell the AI to use a "side-view foreshortened" or "curled up" death pose.

  Updated prompt snippet for the "Die" action:
  > "...for the dying sequence, the character should collapse into a crumpled heap or fall at an angle toward the viewer to fit within a narrow vertical
  frame, ensuring no part of the body is cut off by the side edges."

  Would you like me to check the current `Fighter.js` code to see how hard it would be to switch the game to 400x400 frames? That would give you much more
  "cinematic" looking sprites.

> also for the punching and kicking poses, the AI generates a more square , becauase the arm and the leg are extended, how do I need to fix the promop ?

✦ To fit a character's extended limbs (punches and kicks) into a narrow 200x400 frame, you have to move away from a "pure side profile" and use
  foreshortening.

  In a pure side profile, a punch is a long horizontal line. In a 3/4 view, the arm is coming partially toward the camera, making it look long but taking up
  very little horizontal space on the screen.

  Here are the specific prompt adjustments to fix the "square" problem:

  1. Change the Viewpoint (The "3/4 Trick")
  Replace "side profile view" with "3/4 profile view" or "slight perspective." This allows the limbs to extend "forward-diagonal" instead of "left-to-right."

  2. Specify Vertical Actions
  Instead of generic "punching," ask for actions that use the 400px height.
   * Keywords: "Uppercuts," "High kicks," "Axe kicks," "Overhead strikes."

  3. Add "Negative Space" Constraints
  Tell the AI to keep the character "thin."
   * Keywords: "Compact fighting stance," "Narrow horizontal footprint," "Tucked elbows," " limbs extending toward the viewer."

  4. Updated "Pro" Prompt
  Try this version of your prompt:

  > "See attached; full body character spritesheet, 3/4 profile view, 3D rendered style, Unreal Engine 5, realistic lighting. The image is a grid of action
  sequences: compact punching (foreshortened), high-angle kicking, hit reaction, and curled-up dying pose. Character must maintain a narrow vertical profile.
  High fidelity, isolated on solid white background, consistent model, centered in frames with wide side margins, --no blur, noise, cropped, shadows --v 6.0
  --ar 1:1"

  ---

  Why this works:
   * 3/4 View: The arm doesn't go ----->, it goes /. It looks like a powerful punch but stays within the 200px width.
   * Wide Side Margins: By telling the AI to keep "wide side margins," you force it to scale the character down slightly so the extension doesn't hit the
     edge.
   * High-Angle Kicking: Directs the AI to use the 400px height instead of the 200px width.

  One Final Tip:
  If you find that the AI simply cannot produce a good punch in 200px width (because the character is too "thick" or detailed), we can easily update the game
  code to use 400x400 frames. 

  Do you want me to modify `Fighter.js` and the `rosterConfig.js` right now to support 400x400? This would give your AI much more room to breathe and allow
  for much cooler, wider attack animations.

> why we deciden a rectangle in first place and not a sqaure in first place ?

✦ The choice of 200x400 (1:2 ratio) was likely made for three specific technical and stylistic reasons, but those reasons often clash with how AI likes to
  work.

  1. Texture Memory (Mobile Performance)
  A fighting game loads many spritesheets at once. 
   * 200x400: An 8x4 grid results in a 1600x1600 texture. This is small, fast to load, and works on every phone made in the last 10 years.
   * 400x400: An 8x4 grid results in a 3200x1600 texture. This uses double the RAM. On a high-end iPhone it's fine, but on older devices, loading 10
     characters might crash the browser.

  2. Screen Real Estate
  On a phone screen in landscape mode, the height is limited. If characters are 400px wide while just standing still, they take up half the stage. A 200px
  width allows for more "footsies" (movement back and forth) and makes the stage feel larger.

  3. Nostalgic Style
  Old-school games like Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter used narrow vertical rectangles because human bodies are taller than they are wide.

  ---

  The "AI Conflict"
  The problem is that AI models (like Midjourney or DALL-E) are trained on square photos. When you ask for a "Full Body Shot," the AI automatically tries to
  fill a square. 
   * If we force it into a 200x400 box, the AI thinks the character is "too skinny" and starts to glitch.
   * If the AI generates a square, and we crop it to 200x400, we cut off the arms and legs.

  My Suggestion: Switch to 400x400
  Since your primary workflow is AI generation, the 200x400 restriction is hurting you more than it's helping the game. 

  I recommend we update the code to 400x400.
   1. AI will follow the prompt better because it can draw full arm extensions and legs.
   2. Lying on the floor will look much more natural.
   3. Modern Phones can easily handle the 3200x1600 texture size.

  Shall I update `Fighter.js` and the `ASSET_GUIDELINES.md` to support 400x400 frames? This will make your "Nano Banana Pro" prompt work much more reliably.

    My Recommendation
    Since you are using AI to generate these, stick to the 200x400 logic for now but tell the AI to use a "side-view foreshortened" or "curled up" death pose.

    Updated prompt snippet for the "Die" action:
    > "...for the dying sequence, the character should collapse into a crumpled heap or fall at an angle toward the viewer to fit within a narrow vertical
    frame, ensuring no part of the body is cut off by the side edges."

✦ To make the AI respect the 200x400 rectangle, we need to use keywords that prioritize verticality and depth over horizontal width.

  Here is a highly optimized prompt designed to keep the character "thin" enough for the 200px width while using the 400px height effectively.

  The "Vertical-First" Spritesheet Prompt

  > Prompt:
  > "Full body character spritesheet of [INSERT CHARACTER DESCRIPTION HERE], 3/4 profile view, 8x4 grid, 3D rendered style, Unreal Engine 5, realistic
  textures, pure white background. Compact fighting stance with narrow horizontal footprint. Action sequences include: idle, walk, foreshortened punches
  extending toward camera, high vertical axe-kicks, hit reaction, and a crumpled heap death pose. All poses must be taller than they are wide, centered in
  frames with wide empty side margins to prevent limb clipping. High fidelity, sharp focus, consistent model --no shadows, perspective distortion, blur, or
  noise --v 6.0 --ar 1:1"

  ---

  Why this prompt works for 200x400:

   1. "3/4 Profile View": By turning the character slightly toward the camera, a punch that would be 300px wide in a flat side-view becomes only 100px wide
      because of perspective (foreshortening).
   2. "Compact fighting stance / Narrow horizontal footprint": This explicitly tells the AI not to let the character spread their legs or arms too wide.
   3. "Foreshortened punches extending toward camera": This is the secret. It makes the attack look powerful and long, but on the 2D plane of the screen, the
      arm stays within the character's body width.
   4. "High vertical axe-kicks": Instead of a "roundhouse" (which is wide), an axe-kick or high-knee uses the 400px height we have available.
   5. "Crumpled heap death pose": This prevents the "plank" problem. The character collapses downward into a pile rather than sliding out horizontally.
   6. "Wide empty side margins": AI loves to fill the frame. By asking for "wide margins," you force the character to be smaller and centered, giving us the
      "air" we need to crop them into 200x400 without losing a hand or a foot.

  Pro-Tip for "The Floor"
  If the AI still struggles with the death pose, you can try adding this specific instruction to the end:
  > "...for the lying flat frames, the character is tilted diagonally from top-left to bottom-right to fit the narrow vertical space."

  Would you like me to write a quick Python script that you can run on your computer to "slice and dice" the image the AI gives you into the exact 1600x1600
  sheet the game needs? That way, even if the AI layout is slightly messy, we can fix it automatically.

> what about this poses, please explain ,   8.  **Frames 19-22 (Row 3):** Intro sequence (4 frames).
    9.  **Frames 23 (Row 3), 24-26 (Row 4):** Victory pose (4 frames).
    10. **Frames 27-28 (Row 4):** Crumple/Knockdown (2 frames).

✦ These three sequences are the "personality" of your character. Because we are using a 200x400 rectangle, these poses need to be very "tight" and vertical.

  Here is an explanation of each, and how to make them work within that narrow 200px width:

  8. Intro Sequence (Frames 19-22)
  This is the "Entrance" the character makes before the fight starts.
   * The Goal: Show who the character is.
   * Visual Idea: Since you only have 200px of width, don't have them walk in from the side (they will be cut off). Instead, have them perform a vertical
     action.
   * Example: The character looking at the ground, then looking up at the camera and cracking their knuckles.
   * AI Tip: Ask for a "facing-forward taunt" or "adjusting fighting gloves".

  9. Victory Pose (Frames 23-26)
  This is the "Reward" screen (and the loop that plays during the slideshow).
   * The Goal: A proud, triumphant moment.
   * Visual Idea: This is the easiest to fit in 200x400 because humans naturally get "tall" when they win.
   * Example: Raising a fist high in the air, crossing arms and nodding, or pointing a finger at the camera.
   * AI Tip: Ask for "triumphant overhead gesture" or "proud standing pose". Avoid "celebration jumps" which might make them go too wide.

  10. Crumple / Knockdown (Frames 27-28)
  This is the "Stagger" that happens right before they hit the floor. It’s the transition from standing to dying.
   * The Goal: Show the character losing their balance and starting to fall.
   * Visual Idea: The character should be folding at the waist.
   * Example: Frame 27 is the character's knees hitting the ground; Frame 28 is their hands touching the floor as they start to collapse.
   * AI Tip: Ask for "collapsing onto knees" or "stumbling backwards while clutching stomach".

  How to update your AI Prompt for these:
  To get these specific sequences in your grid, you should add this "Scenario Section" to your prompt:

  > "...the sequence must include: (Intro) a vertical 4-frame taunt looking at camera, (Victory) a 4-frame pose with a fist raised high, and (Defeat) a
  2-frame sequence of the character collapsing onto their knees followed by a 3-frame lying flat pose tilted diagonally to fit the frame."

  Summary of the "Golden Rule" for 200x400:
  Whenever a character does something "wide" (like a big kick or falling down), tilt them toward the camera. 
   * Instead of: _ (lying flat) 
   * Use: / (tilted toward the corner)

  This uses the hypotenuse (diagonal) of your rectangle, which gives you about 440 pixels of room instead of just 200
