# Product Mission

## Pitch
Shaomeme Fighter is a personalized mobile web fighting game that helps my girlfriend blow off steam by fighting playful caricatures of family and annoyances, rewarding victories with cherished photo memories from our travels.

## Users

### Primary Customers
- **The Girlfriend**: The sole player and recipient of this gift. Uses an iPad/iPhone.

### User Personas
**The Girlfriend**
- **Role:** Player
- **Context:** Relaxing at home, using iPad/iPhone.
- **Pain Points:** Needs small distractions/entertainment; standard games aren't personalized.
- **Goals:** Have fun, vent frustration playfully, relive shared memories.

## The Problem

### Generic Entertainment
Existing mobile games lack personal connection and relevance.

**Our Solution:** A custom-built fighting game where the characters, stages, and rewards are deeply personal and relevant to her life.

## Differentiators

### Deep Personalization
Unlike any other fighting game, the roster consists of real-life acquaintances, the stages are places we've actually visited, and the "loot" is unlocking real photo memories.

## Key Features

### Core Features
- **Invisible Combat Zones:** Intuitive touch controls (split screen) optimized for iPad without cluttering the UI with buttons.
- **Memory Arenas:** Stages based on real cities we've visited.
- **Photo Rewards:** Winning a fight unlocks a slideshow of photos from that specific location (sourced from Nextcloud).

### Content Features
- **Custom Roster:** Play as herself; fight against family members and specific people who annoy her.
