# Verification Report: Portrait Mode Ken Burns

**Spec:** `2025-12-23-portrait-mode-ken-burns`
**Date:** 2025-12-23
**Verifier:** implementation-verifier
**Status:** ✅ Passed

---

## Executive Summary

The Portrait Mode Ken Burns feature has been successfully implemented and refined. The slideshow now supports portrait photos with a dedicated "fitted" layout, a Polaroid border that appears on top of the image, and a gentle "shake/zoom" Ken Burns effect applied to the entire frame. The "VICTORY" title was removed to maximize photo visibility, and overall picture size has been increased.
