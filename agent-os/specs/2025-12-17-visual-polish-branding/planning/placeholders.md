# Placeholders & Missing Assets

## Audio
- **UI Select/Confirm Sound:** Currently using `attack1.mp3` as a placeholder. Need a dedicated `ui-select.mp3` (e.g., a "gong" or "punch" impact).
- **UI Hover Sound:** Missing. No placeholder currently implemented (silence). Need `ui-hover.mp3` (e.g., light "whoosh").
- **UI Back/Cancel Sound:** Missing. No placeholder. Need `ui-back.mp3`.

## Fonts
- **Mortal Kombat Font:** Currently using `PressStart2P` (pixel art style). The specific "Mortal Kombat" style font (`mk1.ttf` or similar) is missing from the `refs/` directory.

## Visuals
- **Slideshow Fallback:** If no photos are found, we show text. A dedicated "No Photos" graphic could be better.
