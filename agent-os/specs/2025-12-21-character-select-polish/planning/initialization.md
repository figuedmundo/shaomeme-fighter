## Feature: Character Select Polish (Task 5.2)

From Roadmap:

- **Stage Preview** — Improve arena preview when selected (currently just text/thumbnails in ArenaSelect, but maybe we want a preview _during_ character select or a better transition).
- **Zoom Camera** — Close-up on selected character for dramatic effect.
- **Voice Lines** — Ensure character voice lines are perfectly synced with selection and zoom.
