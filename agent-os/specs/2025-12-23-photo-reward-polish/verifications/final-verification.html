## 4. Test Suite Results

**Status:** ⚠️ Some Failures (Unrelated)

### Test Summary
- **Total Tests:** 233
- **Passing:** 231
- **Failing:** 2
- **Errors:** 0

### Failed Tests
- `tests/AssetDimensions.test.js > Fighter Spritesheet Integrity > should have an 8x4 grid (1600x1600) spritesheet for witch`
  - Reason: `witch.png` file missing. This seems unrelated to this spec as "witch" is not in the current roster config used by the game, but tests expect 7 characters while roster has 6.
- `tests/rosterConfig.test.js > Roster Configuration > should have the correct number of characters`
  - Reason: Expected 7, received 6. Likely due to a previous removal of a character ("witch"?) without updating tests.

### Notes
All new tests related to `VictorySlideshow` passed. The failures are pre-existing roster configuration issues and do not impact the Photo Reward Polish feature.
