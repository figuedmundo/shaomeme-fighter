## Executive Summary

The Character Roster Integration feature has been successfully implemented. The game now features a "Character Select" screen styled after Mortal Kombat 11 (central grid, dynamic portraits), populated by a configurable roster of 7 characters. The navigation flow has been updated to `MainMenu` -> `CharacterSelect` -> `ArenaSelect` -> `FightScene`, with the selected character ID being passed correctly through the chain. All 30 automated tests are passing.
