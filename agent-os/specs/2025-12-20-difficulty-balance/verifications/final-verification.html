# Verification Report: Difficulty & Balance

**Spec:** `2025-12-20-difficulty-balance`
**Date:** December 20, 2025
**Verifier:** implementation-verifier
**Status:** ✅ Passed

---

## Executive Summary

The Difficulty and Balance system has been successfully implemented. A central `combatConfig` now drives fighter statistics, allowing for easy tuning. An `AIInputController` has been integrated into `FightScene.js`, enabling the AI opponent to make decisions (Approach, Attack, Block, Retreat) based on configurable difficulty profiles (Easy, Medium, Hard). This ensures a fair and scalable challenge for the player on mobile devices.
