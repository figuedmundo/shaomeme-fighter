# Verification Report: Credits Letter

**Spec:** `2026-01-04-credits-letter`
**Date:** Sunday, January 4, 2026
**Verifier:** implementation-verifier
**Status:** ⚠️ Passed with Issues (3 unrelated test failures)

---

## Executive Summary

The "Credits Letter" feature has been successfully implemented, introducing a heartfelt introductory sequence to the Credits Scene. The implementation features a polished typewriter effect and responsive touch interactions. While the new feature's tests pass perfectly, three existing tests in the Exif Extraction suite were found to be failing, which appear to be unrelated to this implementation.

## 4. Test Suite Results

**Status:** ⚠️ Some Failures (Unrelated to this feature)

### Test Summary
- **Total Tests:** 305
- **Passing:** 302
- **Failing:** 3
- **Errors:** 0

### Failed Tests
- `tests/ExifExtraction.test.js`: getPhotoDate should extract DateTimeOriginal when available in EXIF
- `tests/ExifExtraction.test.js`: getPhotoDate should fallback to birthtime when EXIF is missing
- `tests/ExifExtraction.test.js`: getPhotoDate should fallback to birthtime when EXIF exists but has no date

### Notes
The 3 failures are in `ExifExtraction.test.js` and appear to be returning `null` instead of a `Date` object. These tests are unrelated to the `CreditsScene` logic and were likely failing prior to this implementation or are due to environment-specific issues with the `canvas` or `sharp` libraries as indicated by the console warnings. All 6 tests related to the Credits branding (old and new) passed successfully.
