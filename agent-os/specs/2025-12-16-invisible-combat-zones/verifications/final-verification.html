# Verification Report: Invisible Combat Zones

**Spec:** `2025-12-16-invisible-combat-zones`
**Date:** December 16, 2025
**Verifier:** implementation-verifier
**Status:** ✅ Passed

---

## Executive Summary

The "Invisible Combat Zones" feature has been successfully implemented, providing a robust split-screen touch control system optimized for mobile devices. The implementation includes a `TouchInputController` that manages a virtual joystick on the left for movement and tap gestures on the right for combat. Visual feedback (joystick graphics and tap ripples) has been integrated, and the system seamlessly interoperates with the existing `Fighter` class logic.
