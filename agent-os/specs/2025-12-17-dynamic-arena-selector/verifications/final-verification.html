# Verification Report: Dynamic Arena Selector

**Spec:** `2025-12-17-dynamic-arena-selector`
**Date:** 2025-12-17
**Verifier:** implementation-verifier
**Status:** ✅ Passed

---

## Executive Summary

The "Dynamic Arena Selector" feature has been successfully implemented and verified. Users can now navigate from the Main Menu to an Arena Select screen, which dynamically fetches city data from the backend. The UI features a high-definition arcade aesthetic with a hero background preview and a thumbnail grid. Selecting an arena correctly transitions to the Fight Scene with the chosen background loaded. All automated tests (unit and integration) are passing cleanly.
