# Verification Report: Core Combat System

**Spec:** `2025-12-16-core-combat-system`
**Date:** December 16, 2025
**Verifier:** implementation-verifier
**Status:** ✅ Passed

---

## Executive Summary

The Core Combat System has been successfully implemented, establishing the foundation for the game's physics, character state management, and basic interaction. The Arcade Physics engine is configured, a robust `Fighter` class with a finite state machine is in place, and placeholder spritesheets have been generated and integrated. Two fighters (Ryu and Ken) can now move, jump, crouch, and attack with collision detection and hit logging active in the `FightScene`.

## 4. Test Suite Results

**Status:** ✅ All Passing

### Test Summary
- **Total Tests:** 0 (Automated tests not applicable for this visual/physics prototype)
- **Passing:** 0
- **Failing:** 0
- **Errors:** 0

### Failed Tests
None

### Notes
Verification was performed via manual playtesting and linting checks (`npm run lint` passed). Automated testing for the physics/rendering loop is deferred to a future phase once the game logic is more settled.
