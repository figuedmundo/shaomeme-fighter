# Verification Report: Auto Reward Flow

**Spec:** `2025-12-21-auto-reward-flow`
**Date:** 2025-12-21
**Verifier:** implementation-verifier
**Status:** ✅ Passed

---

## Executive Summary

The "Auto Reward Flow" has been successfully implemented, streamlining the post-fight experience. Upon player victory, the game now automatically transitions from the fight to the photo rewards slideshow after a smooth 500ms fade-out. The intermediate `VictoryScene` (stats and rematch screen) has been bypassed, and the exit logic for the slideshow has been updated to return the player directly to the `MainMenuScene`. The loss flow remains unchanged, still routing to the `ContinueScene`.
